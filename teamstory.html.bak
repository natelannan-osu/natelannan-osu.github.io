          <h4>Team Story</h4>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <h5>Team Name, institution name, city, and state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </h5>
          <p>Cyclone Cowboys</p>
          <p>Oklahoma State University</p>
          <p>Stillwater, Oklahoma</p>
          <h5>Your faculty advisor and student lead</h5>
          <p>Faculty Advisor: Professor Nate Lannan</p>
          <p>Student Lead: Sahir Virani</p>
          <h5>Why is your team participating in the CWC?</h5>
          <p>We are participating because wind energy is a vital component to
            the overall power supply in Oklahoma. In 2021, 40% of electricity
            generation in the state was powered by wind energy, a figure which
            is increasing annually (US EIA). Therefore, we want to learn about
            how wind energy is generated and how it can be improved and
            expanded.</p>
          <h5>What is your vision for a clean energy future?</h5>
          <p>We believe that individual communities should have the resources
            and knowledge to decide what clean energy solutions work best for
            them. Diverse communities will require a diverse array of solutions
            based on factors such as geography, safety, and existing
            infrastructure.</p>
          <h5>Describe your project, objectives, and game plan.</h5>
          <p>Our project involved designing and testing a small wind turbine,
            planning an offshore wind farm, and developing an outreach program
            for the group. We have selected leaders for each subsection of the
            competition and established a project management team to make work
            completion more efficient.</p>
          <h5>What steps are your team taking to ensure a diverse and inclusive
            team?</h5>
          <p>Our team has recruited students from many different types of
            engineering and non-engineering disciplines, giving the team a vast
            array of areas in which members can apply their specific knowledge.
            Cyclone Cowboys has also been formed into a campus-wide club which
            allows for greater exposure to potential new team members who are
            passionate about wind energy and wish to join. We plan on working
            with the University's Division of Institutional Diversity to get
            more students involved. </p>
          <h5>What does your team do exceptionally well? How will you use your
            team's strengths to your advantage in the competition?</h5>
          <p>Our diversity is our greatest asset. Through expansive recruiting
            and networking, we have built a large team with several different
            majors and experience levels. This allows us the freedom to place
            team members in areas where they are passionate and able to make the
            greatest impact within Cyclone Cowboys. Having team members who are
            proficient in everything from welding to website design will drive
            our success. </p>
          <h5>What inspired your team's name?</h5>
          <p>The Cyclone Cowboys' name was inspired by our school, Oklahoma
            State University, and the windy weather that the state of Oklahoma
            is known for. Although our mascot is Pistol Pete, we are also known
            across the nation as the Cowboys. As a final ode to the Great Plains
            and the severe weather it is known for, we included cyclone in our
            team's name to give another nod to wind energy in Oklahoma. </p>
