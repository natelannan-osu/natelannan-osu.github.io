          <h4><span style="font-family: Nirmala UI;">Who we are</span></h4>
          <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">We are the Cyclone Cowboys from
              Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma! We are
              interested in the future of wind energy and had created a club to
              spread awareness of it at Oklahoma State University and in the
              surrounding community.</span></p>
          <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"> </span>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Originally
              as a senior design project, the Cyclone Cowboys was opened up in
              2022 as a club that any major and grade can join. That has lead to
              freshmen, other engineers, and other majors getting involved in
              wind energy. By having a diverse team, we can look at a problem
              and have many views on how to address it. Problem solving from
              different perspectives means having a unique solution, more in
              depth discussion, and skills from a range of people. Having team
              members who are proficient in everything from welding to website
              design currently drive our success. The rigorous curriculum of OSU
              means that students are equipped with skills, both theoretical and
              technical. Using welding machines, CNC machines, 3D printing, and
              other machinery skills come comfortably to students. Lastly, our
              team is close knit, persistent, and determined enough to overcome
              any obstacles. </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Seniors were interested in
              competing in the Collegiate Wind Competition which is put on
              yearly by the United States Department of Energy. The CWC consists
              of the Turbine Contest, Project Development Contest, and
              Connection Creation Contest (also known as Outreach). The
              competition helps college students prepare for jobs in wind and
              renewable energy industries. By learning about finance for project
              development, how to CAD a turbine and blades, and reaching out to
              local companies or schools to raise awareness of wind energy,
              students learn many valuable workplace skills. It is the Cyclone
              Cowboys first year as a competitor. We were picked along with 13
              other schools to compete in the final phase! </span></p>
