          <h1 style="text-align: left;">Team History Updates</h1>
          <h3 style="  margin-left: 40px;">Here you will find our weekly updates
            so that you can view our progress!</h3>
          <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">January 23, 2023 to February 3, 2023</h4>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Last week was mainly organizing all the
            new members and educating them on all that project development
            entails. As for progress, we began our "improved" property analysis
            to look for more possible lease blocks. We relaxed our restrictions
            on the lease blocks, so we increased to about 13 possible lease
            blocks. The next step will be to begin running simulations on our
            lease blocks.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Modified the driveline so that it would
            resist rotation bending that it was experiencing in the past. Also
            assigned sub teams and got everyone familiar with the turbine.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Outreach Team started the semester
            with&nbsp; new members from the senior design project, so the team
            has made a whole lot of progress since last semester. Within these
            two weeks, we worked on lots of things for the PDR and discussed
            creating posting more on Instagram, as well as creating a Facebook,
            and LinkedIn for the Cyclone Cowboys. On January 30th, we ended up
            rounding the whole team from each subcategory, which made the
            Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

          <h4 style=" margin-left: 40px;">February 6, 2023 to February 10, 2023</h4>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We have two new Furrow simulations near
            completion: primary simulation utlizes three lease blocks sitting at
            about 350 MW worth of wind turbines. Searched for new wind turbines
            to use within Furrow, though might need to reach out to industry
            professionals. Created furrow simulations for new possible locations
            and had a Furrow seminar with Furrow employees and engineers to
            learn more. Have started financial analysis and found a financial
            analysis report published by the DOE for offshore windfarms in 2022.
            Civil's may have found some standards to help guide out wind farm
            design. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Added a cover to the main body and mount
            for rear wing. Changed the rear wing design and assembled everything
            to get it ready for the PDR. Met with civil engineers to get
            prelimiary anchor designs for the PDR. Wanted tos tart building
            parts to test the turbine. Met with Dr. Rouser to tour ATRC Wind
            tunnel and planned to give power to blades in wind tunnel to measure
            torque and drag. Printed nacelle, nose cone, modified driveline in
            CAD, started CNCing the driveline/driveshaft. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We created a Facebook and Linkedin for
            the Cyclone Cowboys, as well as a Campus Link where we had all our
            members join and follow our social media. We created and posted
            three social media posts on all three of our sites and began
            prepping for the CDR. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>

          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Progress in financial analysis and wind
            farm simulations. Finding new wind turbines for analysis. We found a
            new wind turbine, however, not he desired turbine. Awaiting
            responses from Vestas and General Electric requesting specifications
            for turbines.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Goal was to get turbine ready to
            assemble. Had finished the front of drive shaft and rear is halfway
            CNCed. Finalized first revision of the blades and changed the nose
            cone to fit the new front drive shaft. Spoke with the civil
            engineers to come up with an anchor design. Also edited blade tips
            to adapt to each other. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We created a Facebook and LinkedIn for
            the Cyclone Cowboys, as well as a Campus Link where we had all our
            members join the Campus Link and follow the new social media we
            created. We created and posted 3 social media posts on all 3 of our
            social media sites and began prepping for the CDR. </p>

          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Find standards, finalize financial
            analysis of new wind farm design, and make CDR slides. All completed
            except for one CDR slide. Make new wind turbine files, but were not
            completed. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Finalized drive line prototype. Finished
            blade version 3 and started blade versioon 4. We had reinforced the
            base of the blade. Modified nose cone design and printed version 8
            of it. Began assembling the driveline, nacelle, and blades. Also got
            ready for the CDR and are ever close to testing!</p>

          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Finished CDR, need to get standards and
            hear back from other teams about turbine data. All was completed. </p>
          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We tested sensors and narrowed down buck
            boost options. Hoping to code teensy soon and get parts tested and
            installed. Finsihed CDR and had the presentation for it. Need to get
            blades tested in wind tunnel and to get driveline rotationally
            tested. </p>
          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We created and posted 1 social media

          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Assign standards to be read. Need to
            find new wind turbines for analysis. Need to complete/start hub
            height analysis and find an answer for distance from a pipeline.</p>
          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Continued testing: driveline has been
            tested and we have finalized plans for how we are going to test it
            in the wind tunnel. We want to get blade analysis done with QBlade
            software soon. Tested the torque required to move the driveline.
            Learned that we need to offload our power generated when doing our
            blade tests which lead to meeting a PhD student, John Johnsen, to
            discuss how to use the wind tunnel well. Met with electrical team to
            test VC sensors and calculate minimum required resistance based off
            our power calculations. We modified the Nacelle by drilling holes
            into it for the motor and break system, then assembled it with the
            break and motor components. Anchor has been built.</p>
          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>

          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Organize the team and assign work to all
            people. Civils are creating site development plans. Calvin is
            started a financial report. Brady is learning SAM and Tucker is
            researching environmental date. Hunter is analyzing new wind
            turbines in the furrow.</p>
          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Anchor testing completed and blades were
            tested. The week basically led up to testing the blades. A buck
            booster has been selected and possibly ordered. </p>

          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Make sure everyone is making progress on
            tasks and create new Furrow simulations for analysis. Had to help
            Civils with something for their class and got that completed. Ran
            into more issues with Furrow but I am working on it now. Learned how
            to import wind farm layout into SAM. Looking for more turbine files
            for analysis. Calvin stated writing a rough financial report. </p>
          <h5 style=" margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Tail was redesigned and blades are
            wanted to be optimized and reprinted. The newest version of the
            nacelle has been manufactured; body and driveline also assembled.
            Electrical resistive network schematic has been drawn and should be
            manufactured soon. New body was printed and tested, servo also
            tested to see how well it breaks. </p>

            Wanted to perform more blade tests but printing had issues. Stress
            tests have shown that the blades can withstand up to 3000 RPM which
            gives us confidence for future wind tunnel testing. Mechanical
            systems have been assembled. Tested yaw system and printed new
            strong blades. Did rotational stress test and axial bending test.
            Print of TSR3 was done. Made a new design of TSR 2.8. Board printed
            for buck booster. Ordered converter circuit. Sensor and servo were
            also tested. Passed safety inspection for basic passive load.
            Driveline has been modified. </p>
