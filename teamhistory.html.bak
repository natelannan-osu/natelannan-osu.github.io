          <h1 style="text-align: left;">Team History Updates</h1>
          <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">January 23, 2023 to February 3, 2023</h4>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Last week was mainly organizing all the
            new members and educating them on all that project development
            entails. As for progress, we began our "improved" property analysis
            to look for more possible lease blocks. We relaxed our restrictions
            on the lease blocks, so we increased to about 13 possible lease
            blocks. The next step will be to begin running simulations on our
            lease blocks.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Modified the driveline so that it would
            resist rotation bending that it was experiencing in the past. Also
            assigned sub teams and got everyone familiar with the turbine.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The Outreach Team started the semester
            with&nbsp; new members from the senior design project, so the team
            has made a whole lot of progress since last semester. Within these
            two weeks, we worked on lots of things for the PDR and discussed
            creating posting more on Instagram, as well as creating a Facebook,
            and LinkedIn for the Cyclone Cowboys. On January 30th, we ended up
            rounding the whole team from each subcategory, which made the
            Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
          </p>
          <h4 style=" margin-left: 40px;">February 6, 2023 to February 10, 2023</h4>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We have two new Furrow simulations near
            completion: primary simulation utlizes three lease blocks sitting at
            about 350 MW worth of wind turbines. Searched for new wind turbines
            to use within Furrow, though might need to reach out to industry
            professionals. Created furrow simulations for new possible locations
            and had a Furrow seminar with Furrow employees and engineers to
            learn more. Have started financial analysis and found a financial
            analysis report published by the DOE for offshore windfarms in 2022.
            Civil's may have found some standards to help guide out wind farm
            design. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Added a cover to the main body and mount
            for rear wing. Changed the rear wing design and assembled everything
            to get it ready for the PDR. Met with civil engineers to get
            prelimiary anchor designs for the PDR. Wanted tos tart building
            parts to test the turbine. Met with Dr. Rouser to tour ATRC Wind
            tunnel and planned to give power to blades in wind tunnel to measure
            torque and drag. Printed nacelle, nose cone, modified driveline in
            CAD, started CNCing the driveline/driveshaft. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Outreach Team</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We created a Facebook and Linkedin for
            the Cyclone Cowboys, as well as a Campus Link where we had all our
            members join and follow our social media. We created and posted
            three social media posts on all three of our sites and began
            prepping for the CDR. </p>

          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Progress in financial analysis and wind
            farm simulations. Finding new wind turbines for analysis. We found a
            new wind turbine, however, not he desired turbine. Awaiting
            responses from Vestas and General Electric requesting specifications
            for turbines.</p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Goal was to get turbine ready to
            assemble. Had finished the front of drive shaft and rear is halfway
            CNCed. Finalized first revision of the blades and changed the nose
            cone to fit the new front drive shaft. Spoke with the civil
            engineers to come up with an anchor design. Also edited blade tips
            to adapt to each other. </p>

          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Project Development</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Find standards, finalize financial
            analysis of new wind farm design, and make CDR slides. All completed
            except for one CDR slide. Make new wind turbine files, but were not
            completed. </p>
          <h5 style="margin-left: 40px;">Turbine Design</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Finalized drive line prototype. Finished
            blade version 3 and started blade versioon 4. We had reinforced the
            base of the blade. Modified nose cone design and printed version 8
            of it. Began assembling the driveline, nacelle, and blades. Also got
            ready for the CDR and are ever close to testing!</p>
